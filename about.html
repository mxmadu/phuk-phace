            <p>'Pretty Privilege' sounds more like a pop culture term that gets thrown around in conversations about 
                celebrities and influencers and less of a phenomenon that might have real and very different consequences 
                for people. If you think about it, it could be both.
                <br>
                <br>
                Consider every time you've met someone for the first time, the first things you notice about them. 
                Consider all the people you've walked by on the street, people you couldn't describe save for maybe 
                one or two traits. What kind of story would you write about them if asked?
                <br>
                <br>
                Desirability politics is often discussed in the context of romantic and intimate relationships, 
                as the numerous -isms and -phobias that make dating harder for those not considered the 'beauty standard'. 
                However, this can be extended to include other aspects of life where one's success can be hindered by 
                implicit biases. That is to say, the same prejudices that make dating harder for non-white, fat or disabled 
                people can also make it harder for them to get ahead at work or build strong social connections because of 
                stereotypes people may believe about them.

    </div>
     <div class="about-container">
        <p>
            The source of these biases or the study of why they work so well is a 
            deeper psychological and sociological study that goes back centuries as humans have 
            long sought to define beauty. These have been passed down to us in visual 
            cues we see on screen, in books, on billboards and they tell us many things in 
            very few words: ugly = bad. They have also told us what ugly looks like and 
            advertising has driven this home with harsh binaries that pit features against 
            one another: dark vs light skin, big vs. small noses, round faces vs. narrow ones.
            <br>
            <br>
            These are further expanded on in film and television, where characters 
            are introduced quickly with specifically constructed visual features to 
            tell you just how good or bad they are, and (just like in this project) some 
            ominous music to seal the deal. No doubt, there are characters out there with 
            whacky enough features that they could have only come from the imagination, 
            playing specific roles in their even whackier stories, but most cases 
            unfortunately are not born in a vacuum and the characters are designed to look 
            like things we already fear or hate in real life.
            <br>
            <br>
            Just as the origins of these depictions are influenced by the structures our society has in place, 
            so too are the technological developments we rely on today, particularly artificial intelligence and machine 
            learning, which are being entrusted with the responsibility of sorting individuals into predetermined categories. 
            This results in a system which, according to Wendy Hui Kyong Chun in Discriminating Data: Correlation, Neighborhoods, 
            and the New Politics of Recognition, “condemns complexity and ambiguity as hypocrisy”, forcing us to behave and read 
            others as though we were nothing more than 1s and 0s.

            &lt;PRETTY_HURTS_UGLY_KILLS&gt; seeks to draw attention to this, 
            calling out things we ordinarily won't notice about how we've been taught to see one another. 
            While it may mean little that evil characters are presented with certain physical 
            traits, the consequences of this messaging are already here as evidenced in the 
            screenshots above from a Pinterest search on 'evil villain character design' that pulls up 
            numerous images of dark-skinned people. These biases are built into our technology, 
            creating a potentially scary reality for people who are thought of as suspicious or 
            morally bankrupt based on how they present. This justifies an increased apathy towards 
            those in society we deride and mock on a regular basis.
            <br>
            <br>
            So even as the constant pursuit of beauty comes at the expense of time, money, 
            relationships, and potentially even your health, being ugly could cost you a whole lot more.
